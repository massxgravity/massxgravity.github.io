The bench uses magnet pairs on the bench top and legs to hold the bench in the standing position and the folded position. This bench was built because it seemed like all the travel benches were either too heavy, too thick, or had moving parts which are susceptible to wear. Plus I just wanted to do something different. 

## Dimensions
- 14" x 4.5" x 1.5"
- Bench stands 6.75" in use
- I'm 200 lbs and 5'11" and it fits me just fine

## Materials

*16 [10x3mm Rare Earth Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GLS59JS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).* The linked magnets are regular enough that cutting a 10mm hole always leads to a friction fit.  
  
*1 Linear Meter of 19mm Baltic Birch Plywood.* I get mine from wurth baer.  
  
[Rubio Monocoat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VRR3NZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  

## Tools Used
- Shaper origin
- Orbital Sander
- 1/4" Compression Bit
- 1/2" rando bit??

  
## Instructions

### Cutting

#### The Top
![](_L1130563.jpeg)

Unfortunately this step is going to be a little different for each sheet of ply (or even each bench from the same sheet). After doing a first pass around the base plates at .3" I check the surface. Sometimes I get lucky and .3" lands right in the middle of a veneer and then I can switch to the 1/2" bit and bore out the rest of the base. Sometimes I'm not so lucky and I'll make another pass at .32" or .35" and keep going till I land in the middle of a veneer. The only reason I start at .3" is that my compression bit doesn't start compressing until then.

#### The Tops of the Legs
*Setting the Grid.* The blue guide in the [shaper svg](_leg-top.svg) should roughly represent the dimensions of the top of each leg. I created the guide so that you can create a grid and index the bottom left (or whatever corner) of the grid with the bottom left corner of the digital image. The guide has an 18mm thickness so if your stock is thinner you might consider changing the digital file to match. This usually works out of the box as most stock I buy is around 17.7mm-18.2mm. By building the tenon always slightly smaller than the stock, we can ensure a good fit.
The “Seamless Watch” watch has all the features that users expect in a digital watch, and some unusual features.


The watch has the following features:

Time and date displayed on the screen. Current time is in large numbers, date is in small numbers above it.

Light: Pressing the light button on the side of the watch activates a light while the button is pressed. Pressing and holding that button for 3 seconds turns on the light and keeps it on, until the button is held again for 3 seconds or up to 2 hours. After 2 hours, it will automatically turn off.

Alarm. A daily alarm may be set for a given time. The alarm may be enabled or disabled. When the alarm is enabled and the alarm time is reached, the watch will beep fast for 5 seconds, then slowly for 30 seconds, then fast for another 5 seconds. Pressing any button stops the alarm sound (in addition to performing its normal function).

Timer. Timer mode shows a count-up timer that starts at 00:00. When the timer is started, it counts up. Pressing the start/stop button will pause the timer, pressing it again continues counting up. Pressing and holding the button for 3 seconds resets the timer to 00:00 and stops counting.

Mystery answer. After entering this mode, the screen initially displays “ask now”. The user may ask a yes-or-no question aloud and press the start/stop button, this will display a randomly selected answer that is one of the following: “yeah”, “yeah right”, “no”, “no doubt”, “keep trying”, “keep dreaming”. Whenever the display has more than one word, only one word is displayed for 2 seconds, then the other word is displayed for 2 seconds, alternately. The answer is displayed until the user leaves this mode, or he/she presses start/stop again for a new answer. 


Note: these strings are for the English version of the watch, we will need to use completely different strings in other countries without reprogramming the logic of the watch.

The user may cycle among all modes (date/time, timer, mystery answer) by pressing the mode button.
